        <p>The liger is a hybrid offspring of a male lion and a female tiger. The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called the tigon, and is the largest of all known extant felines. They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons.</p>
        <p>The liger is often believed to be the largest known cat in the world.[1] Males reach a total length of 3 to 3.6 m (9.8 to 11.8 ft),[8][9] which means that they rival even large male lions and tigers in length.[10] Imprinted genes may be a factor contributing to the large size of ligers.[11] These are genes that may or may not be expressed on the parent they are inherited from, and that occasionally play a role in issues of hybrid growth. For example, in some dog breed crosses, genes that are expressed only when maternally-inherited cause the young to grow larger than is typical for either parent breed. This growth is not seen in the paternal breeds, as such genes are normally "counteracted" by genes inherited from the female of the appropriate breed.[12]</p>
        <p>As with the tigon, the liger exists only in captivity. Historically, the Asiatic lion and the Bengal tiger co-occurred in some Asian countries, and there are legends of male lions mating with tigresses in the wilderness, or of ligers existing there.[3] The two species' ranges are known to overlap in India's Gir National Park, though no ligers were known to live there until the modern era.[26] The range of the Caspian tiger has overlapped with that of the lion in places such as northern Iran and eastern Anatolia.</p>
